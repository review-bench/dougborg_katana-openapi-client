"""Prefab UI builders for Katana MCP Server tool responses.

Provides reusable Prefab component builders that produce rich interactive UIs
for MCP Apps-capable hosts (Claude Desktop, etc.) via the
``ui://prefab/renderer.html`` resource auto-registered by fastmcp 3.x.

Usage::

    from katana_mcp.tools.prefab_ui import (
        build_search_results_ui,
        build_item_detail_ui,
        build_po_create_ui,
        build_so_create_ui,
        build_mo_create_ui,
    )

    # In a tool's *_to_tool_result function:
    items_dicts = [item.model_dump() for item in response.items]
    app = build_search_results_ui(items_dicts, query, response.total_count)
    return make_tool_result(response, ui=app)

Design conventions
------------------

**Link Katana entities wherever possible.** When a card displays a
field that maps to a Katana entity with a known web URL (suppliers,
customers, products, materials, orders, etc. — see
``katana_mcp.web_urls.EntityKind``), render it as a ``Link`` with
``href`` pointing at the Katana page, not as plain ``Text``.

A real anchor tag is a one-click path to the source of truth, costs
nothing in agent tokens or chat noise, and stays correct regardless
of which host renders the iframe. The variant card uses this pattern
twice (parent product/material on the title; default supplier in
the reference section); future card work should follow the same
shape. If a field corresponds to a Katana entity not yet in
``EntityKind``, add the path template in ``web_urls.py`` and wire
the link.

**Action primitive selection.** Card actions choose between four
host primitives based on intent:

- ``CallTool(tool, arguments={...})`` — deterministic tool re-invocation
  when every required argument is resolvable at card-build time, either
  from the response dict the builder receives or from a
  ``{{ result.<field> }}`` template that resolves against the apply-
  response state. ``Check Inventory`` (with a known SKU) and
  ``View Variant Details`` (with a known sku/variant_id) are the
  canonical follow-up shape. This is also the preview→apply rail:
  the Confirm button fires ``tools/call`` with the original args +
  ``preview=False`` and pushes the structured result back to the
  agent's model context via ``ui/update-model-context``. See ADR-0021
  for the rationale.
- ``OpenLink(url=...)`` — URL navigation; the host opens the link
  directly with no agent round-trip. Used for every ``View in Katana``
  button across the cards.
- ``UpdateContext(content="...")`` — push a chat-context update so the
  agent composes the next call itself. Right primitive when the next-
  step tool needs args the card can't produce (PO needs supplier +
  location + items; "MOs using this material" has no ingredient filter
  today — #758; receive needs per-row items; open-ended modifies). Also
  used on the Cancel button to signal the user opted out without
  polluting the chat history.
- ``SendMessage(...)`` — legacy chat-prompt primitive. Reserved for
  fallback uses where the agent needs to *speak* (rare; usually prefer
  ``UpdateContext``).

      that vary by sub-type (sellable / producible / batch /

    - **Tier 2 — Decision metrics**: variant count (always), lead time
      and MOQ (Product only). Text rows, not Metric components —
      items have too few numeric facts to warrant the visual weight.
    - **Tier 3 — Reference**: UoM, category, purchase UoM (P/M),
      default supplier (P/M, rendered as Link to the Katana supplier
      page), config-axis definitions (P/M), additional info, and the
      nested variants table — a DataTable with per-row CallTool
      drilling into ``get_variant_details``.
    - **Tier 4 — Actions**: sub-type-specific buttons backed by
      ``UpdateContext`` (composing the args is on the agent because the
      item card lacks the variant / location / supplier / target-field
      context the underlying tools need): ``Create Purchase Order`` +
      ``List MOs Using This`` (materials), ``Create Manufacturing Order``

      footer button — the title link replaces it.

    same shape on a single-row entity; this card extends the pattern
    to a parent entity with embedded children.

    Implements the four-tier framework from #537 with the

    - **Tier 1 — Identity**: title as external ``Link`` to the parent
      product page (variants don't have their own page in Katana's web
      app); variant SKU badge; ingredient-count badge. ``Not Producible``
      badge surfaces the mismatch when a non-producible variant
      somehow has BOM rows.
    - **Tier 2 — Decision metrics**: skipped. BOMs are reference data,
      not transactional, so there's no obvious numeric fact that beats
      the ingredient-count badge already in tier 1. The variant card
      (``build_variant_details_ui``) made the same choice on the same
      reasoning.
    - **Tier 3 — Reference**: the BOM rows DataTable. Columns are the
      user-facing fields (ingredient SKU, display name, quantity,
      notes) — NOT the internal BOM-row UUID or the
      ``product_item_id`` / ``product_variant_id`` echo. Per-row click
      drills into ``get_variant_details`` for the ingredient variant.
    - **Tier 4 — Actions**: [Manage BOM] only. Pushed through
      ``UpdateContext`` because the modify payload (add/update/delete
      rows) isn't deterministic from the card's data alone.

    Closes #810 — pre-fix the tool was registered with ``meta=UI_META``

      home currency. Pass this when formatting ``*_in_base_currency`` amounts
      (converted totals).

    Falls back to ``USD`` when ``currency`` is missing so the widget reads
    cleanly even on the path where the response hasn't populated the field.

    ``next_action_buttons`` is a tuple of ``(label, action)`` pairs — the

    composition (UpdateContext).

    The applied-state View-in-Katana link and the per-entity next-action

    both entry paths:

    - In-place morph: the preview response has no ``id`` / ``katana_url``,
      but the direct-apply rail's on_success chain writes the apply
      response into ``state.result`` before flipping ``applied=True``, so

    - Standalone-applied (``is_preview=False``): :func:`_init_create_card_state`
      pre-seeds ``state.result`` from the response, so the same templates
      resolve there too.

    The View-in-Katana button is gated by ``If("result.katana_url")`` so

    fees section so the preview→Confirm in-place morph can surface the

    The build-time ``_render_so_shipping_fees_section`` paints rows
    once at preview time and won't repaint on morph (Python-time
    ``is_preview`` stays True under the iframe's morphed state). We
    instead bind a state-driven ``If("applied")`` summary block to
    these slots; the preview-side ``on_success`` chain SetStates them
    from ``$result.state.*`` after the apply lands.

    Why state slots + ``$result.state.*`` references and not
    ``$result.<field>`` directly: ``$result`` in the on_success Rx
    context resolves to the apply tool's wire-shape ``structured_content``
    — a PrefabApp envelope keyed by ``$prefab`` / ``view`` / ``state``,
    NOT the raw ``SalesOrderResponse``. So the apply-time builder seeds
    these slots into its own ``state.*``, and the preview iframe reads
    off ``$result.state.*`` to morph (documented in
    ``test_apply_button_morphs_card_to_applied_state``).

    Returns a dict with:
    - ``applied_fees_summary`` — operator-facing one-liner.
    - ``applied_fees_failed_count`` — int gating the failed-fees Alert.
    - ``applied_fees_failed_summary`` — pre-formatted multi-line string
      with ``Failed — <description>: <error>`` per failed fee, then a
      retry-coaching line referencing the SO id so the operator knows
      how to recover. The build-time
      :func:`_render_so_shipping_fees_section` Alert carries the same
      coaching but doesn't morph; embedding it here means the
      preview→Confirm morph keeps the recovery instructions visible.
